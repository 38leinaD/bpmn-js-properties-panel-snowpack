# bpmn-js Modeler + Properties Panel Example

This is work in progress to get the [bpmn-js](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js) Modeller and [bpmn-js-properties-panel](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js-properties-panel) working with [snockpack](https://www.snowpack.dev/#snowpack).
The idea is to use the developmemt-approach snowpack offers to not require a bundling-step via e.g. webpack on each change.

## Usage

Run below command to install all dependencies as ES6 Modules.

```
npm install
```

Run below command to serve the webapp via browser-sync.

```
npm start
```

Please note that the is example is not currently working and still work-in-progress.
